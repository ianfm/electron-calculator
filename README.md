# electron-calculator

Goal: make a moderately aesthetic calculator capable of arithmetic.

Depending on how progress goes, would be interested in making a more advanced calculator. It would be cool to see graphing capabilities, user variables, and maybe CAS if I can find an acceptable library. Probably not gonna implement that myself, but I'd like to see the docs/source.

Branching out, it would be cool to build a library of all of the calculations I've encountered in my courses. That way if I want to build a simulator later I will have access to some of the functions I might need.

That would probably involve advanced graphics and mesh calculations.
